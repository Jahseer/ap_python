# 1.  Create a function that will multiply two (2) values that are passed into the function as arguments. 
# Your function should print out the result of the two numbers that have been multiplied.

 def multiply(*args):
    product = 2
    for item in args:
        product *= item
    return product
print(input("product"))




# 2. Creat a function that will do the following calculation. Your function should take in three argument. it should add the first
# two arguments and then the sum of the first two (2) should be divided by the third argument. 
# You function should then print the result. 

#def divid():
    ("10/2")
    if ("10/2")
    product= ("5")
print(" what does 10/2 equal")
print('product')




# 3. Create a elevator function that will run specific lines of code based on the conditions provided by a user. If the user types in 101,
# the function should print out they are going to the boys latin office, if they type in 203, they are going to the gym, 
# and if they type in the letter g, the lobby. else, if the input doesnt match any of the values provided, tell the user that floor doesn't exist and to please
# enter a valid floor number.\

def elevator():
    A = ("boys latin office ")
    B = ("gym")
    G = ("floor dosen't exist")

    floor101=("boys latin office")
    floor203=("gym")

    Print("floor101 + floor203")



# hint you will need to look into using conditional statements

# 4. Write a simple conditional statement that uses a boolean that will print if it is daytime or nighttime.

daytime = int(input("Please enter what part of the day its is : "))
if (daytime = ('10am')and nightime = ('8pm')):
 daytime = True
else:
 nightime = False

if daytime == True:
 print("its daytime")
elif nightime == False:
 print("its not nightime")

# 5. What function would you use if you wanted to add and element/ value to a list data type? Explain why you would use it.

answer5 = (I would use append() because  it always adds the single value/item  to the end of a list) 



# 6. Do some research and find the correct built-in python function that will reverse the order of the following list.
# then print your list in the reverse order.

def Reverse(lst):
   new_lst = lst[::-1]
   return new_lst
 
 
lst = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
print(Reverse(lst))



random_number_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

# 7.Do some research and find the correcrt built-in python function that will allow you to find the largest number in the following list.
# then print the largest number
ranom_number_list2 = [100,230,40,39403,19]

numbers= [100,230,40,39403,19]

largest_number= 39403
print("largest number")

# 8. A security company has hired you as an engineer to help them develop a program that will only let users into the building 
# if they enter a specific password. They given you the following information to use to build this program.
# - they want users to be able to enter a series of codes to get access
# - they want the user to enter an initial password value which is 0001
# - if they get this correct, they then want them to enter another value, which is 3039
# - if this is correct they will get access to the building
# - if they have the wrong answer in either scenario they will get a message saying access denied. 

# 9. What does it mean to call a function? Why do we call functions. 
# you can use the variable below to enter you ansewer. 
answer9='calling a function means to tell your code to runs a set of actions that you told the code to do. we call functions because if we didnt call are code correctly it would print how is suppose to'

# 10. Find and print each value at the specific indexes provided in the list.
# find and print the values/words at index 3, 4, and 6

my_list = ['chicken', 'ice cream' 'string beans']
