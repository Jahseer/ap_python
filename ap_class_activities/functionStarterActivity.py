# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is

 ('A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called')

def starterFunction():
    print("jAHSEER") # instruction 1
    print(2+2) # insturction 2
    print("all done the program") # instruction 3




# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
# the difference between the 2. 

('A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation.')




# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments

def WELCOME(): 
    print("Welcome to Python Programming") 
    WELCOME() 





# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmatic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)\




# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.
