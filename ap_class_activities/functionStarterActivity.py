# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is

 ('A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called')

# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
# the difference between the 2. 

('A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation.')




# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments


def hello(): Jahseer = str(input("Enter your name: ")) if Jahseer: print ("Hello " + str(Jahseer)) else: print("Hello World") return hello()


# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmatic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)\

a = 4 * 8
b = 3 + 3
c = 7 - 3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)


# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.


A = coding_class
B = next_class

next_class = reading

print = next_class

 # i don't think any of this is right i just don't know how to do it
