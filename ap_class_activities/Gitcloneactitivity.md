reate a simple program using the tools we've learned about it class. Your program should contain the following:

- Save your new program file as <b>name_gitCloneFunction.Py</b> 
ex. ian_gitCloneFunction.py

- Your program must be a function
- Your program must take in two datatypes, it can be whatever data types you like.
- Your program must perform some type of action on the data (can loop, check a condition, etc.)
- Your program must output a result.

Once finished, write a brief read.me document, describing you program and exaplaining to another user what your program
does and how to install it. Next, commit and push your work to your repository.

Finally, find a classmate that has also completed these steps. You will now need to visit that
students repository, find their program and clone the program onto your repository. 
follow their steps and test and check if they're program works.

### Part 2

Create a new document, called <b>classFunctionReview.txt</b>
You will review your classmates code by answer the following questions:

1. Was it easy to find your classmates assignment?

3. Was their documentation clear and concise on what their program was designed to do?

2. Was their documnetion clear and concise on how to install their program?

4. When you installed and ran your classmates program, did it work as described?

5. Based on your experience using your classmate's program, as well as what you've learned about programming and documentation,
are there any reccomendations that you would provide to your classmate?

Once completed submit and push your work.

This assignment is due at THE END of class
